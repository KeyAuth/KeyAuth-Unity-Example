# KeyAuth-Unity-Example
KeyAuth Unity Example For The https://keyauth.cc Authentication system.

### **Bugs**

If the default example not added to your software isn't functioning how it should, please join the Discord server https://discord.gg/keyauth and submit the issue in the `#bugs` channel.

However, we do **NOT** provide support for adding KeyAuth to your project. If you can't figure this out you should use Google or YouTube to learn more about the programming language you want to sell a program in.

## What is KeyAuth?

KeyAuth is an Open source authentication system with cloud hosting plans as well. Client SDKs available for [C#](https://github.com/KeyAuth/KeyAuth-CSHARP-Example), [C++](https://github.com/KeyAuth/KeyAuth-CPP-Example), [Python](https://github.com/KeyAuth/KeyAuth-Python-Example), [Java](https://github.com/SprayDown/KeyAuth-JAVA-api), [JavaScript](https://github.com/mazkdevf/KeyAuth-JS-Example), [VB.NET](https://github.com/KeyAuth/KeyAuth-VB-Example), [PHP](https://github.com/KeyAuth/KeyAuth-PHP-Example), [Rust](https://github.com/KeyAuth/KeyAuth-Rust-Example), [Go](https://github.com/mazkdevf/KeyAuth-Go-Example), [Lua](https://github.com/mazkdevf/KeyAuth-Lua-Examples), [Ruby](https://github.com/mazkdevf/KeyAuth-Ruby-Example), and [Perl](https://github.com/mazkdevf/KeyAuth-Perl-Example). KeyAuth has several unique features such as memory streaming, webhook function where you can send requests to API without leaking the API, discord webhook notifications, ban the user securely through the application at your discretion. Feel free to join https://discord.gg/keyauth if you have questions or suggestions.

## Customer connection issues?

This is common amongst all authentication systems. Program obfuscation causes false positives in virus scanners, and with the scale of KeyAuth this is perceived as a malicious domain. So, `keyauth.com` and `keyauth.win` have been blocked by many internet providers. for dashbord, reseller panel, customer panel, use `keyauth.cc`

For API, `keyauth.cc` will not work because I purposefully blocked it on there so `keyauth.cc` doesn't get blocked also. So, you should create your own domain and follow this tutorial video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2SROFJ0eYc. The tutorial video shows you how to create a domain name for 100% free if you don't want to purchase one.
